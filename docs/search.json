    "text": "Problem\nThe introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:\nconsole.log(sum(range(1, 10))); Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.\nNext, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does indeed return 55.\nAs a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2]."

The function is going to take three different parameters start, end, and step. Start is the starting value of the range, and end is the ending value of the range. The step value has a default value for if there is not one given. If start is less than end it will automatically be set to 1, if it is not then it will be set to -1.\n    let array = [];\nThis code line uses an empty array called array.\n    if (step &gt; 0) {\nNow we are going to use an if else loop to keep going from start to end. The code checks to see if step is greater than 0, if it is than we are going to continue to the for loop below and run that.\n      for (let i = start; i &lt;= end; i += step) array.push(i);\nNow we are going to use this for loop inside of the if else loop if step is greater than 0 to move from start to end. We are going to start by initializing i to the value of start. And then we see that as long as i is less than or equal to end we are going to keep running it. After each running of the for loop successfully we are going to take i and add 1 to it until we get to the end where it will stop. I is then going to be pushed to the array.\n    } else {\nElse is part of the if else loop to tell us what we are going to do if step is not greater than 0 to do the opposite of the other for loop.\n      for (let i = start; i &gt;= end; i += step) array.push(i);\nThis for loop is going to be similar but different to make it run from start to finish using step= something less than 0. This will be used for if start to end is going down instead of up. So we once again set i equal to start. Then we are going to run the for loop as long as i is greater than or equal to end. After each iteration of the for loop i is going to decrease by step and i is going to be pushed to the array.\n    }\n    return array;\n  }\nWe are going to use this line to return the array after it has finished its loop using the return command. We said array because that is what we named the array. This is the end of the first function range that when ran is going to get us every number in a range of numbers from the start number to the end number on command.\n  function sum(array) {\nNow we are going to make another function, this time naming it sum as we are going to use it to find the sum of a group of numbers. It is also going to take a parameter of array.\n    let tot = 0;\nWe are going to use a variable named tot and set it to a value of 0. Let is a command that allows us to create a brand new variable in java. Tot is the name of the variable short for the word total that we are setting to 0.\n    for (let value of array) {\nNow we are going to use a for loop to iterate over each one of the elements in our array parameter. The current element that we are on is going to going to be assigned to the variable value that we have.\n      tot += value;\nNow building on that we are going to use this line to add the value of the current element that the code is on the the tot variable we made earlier.\n    }\n    return tot;\n  }\nThis line is going to return the total or tot of what we got to the console so that we can see what it is."
